> A SQL-based mini case study that simulates a food-tech platform like Zomato.  
> We explore user behavior, product performance, gold membership benefits, and a points-based reward system using a **sample dataset**.

Designed to work on **sample data**, yet scalable to any large-scale food delivery dataset!

## Dataset Overview

We simulate 4 core tables:

| Table Name         | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `users`            | User info & signup date                          |
| `sales`            | Transaction log (user, date, product purchased)  |
| `product`          | Menu items and prices                            |
| `goldusers_signup` | Records of users joining the Gold membership     |

> The dataset was generated using basic SQL insert statements. The goal was to analyze behavior, loyalty, and business impact using SQL only.

## Business Questions Answered

Below is the list of analytical questions explored through SQL in this project:

1. What is the total amount each customer spent on Zomato?
2. How many days has each customer visited the platform?
3. What was the **first product** purchased by each customer?
4. What is the **most purchased product** on the menu, and how many times was it bought?
5. What is the **most popular product for each individual customer**?
6. What product was purchased **after** becoming a Gold Member?
7. What was the **last product bought before** a customer became a Gold Member?
8. What is the **total number of orders and amount spent** by each member **before** joining the Gold program?
9. Using a custom reward system, how many **Zomato points** did each customer and each product accumulate?
10. In the **first year of Gold Membership**, how many points did users earn using a fixed reward scheme (5 points per ‚Çπ10)?
11. Rank all transactions of each customer based on their date.
12. Rank **only Gold Member transactions**, and assign `"NA"` to those that were not made under the membership.

Rather than list each query, let's focus on the **key business insights** that emerged from this project:

### Highlights From Our Analysis

- **Most Purchased Product:**  
  We identified the most frequently ordered item on the menu ‚Äî this helps prioritize popular products in marketing and inventory planning.

```sql
SELECT userid, COUNT(product_id) as No_of_Purchases
FROM sales 
WHERE product_id = (
    SELECT s.product_id as Product_ID
    FROM sales s
    GROUP BY s.product_id
    ORDER BY COUNT(userid) DESC
    LIMIT 1
)
GROUP BY userid;
```

</div>



- **Post-Membership Behavior:**  
  Analyzed the first product users purchased after joining the Gold Membership program. Repeated patterns here indicate products that keep users engaged after upgrade.

```sql
SELECT userid, product_id
FROM (
	SELECT s.userid, s.product_id, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.userid ORDER BY s.created_date) as rn
	FROM (
		SELECT * 
		FROM sales
		ORDER BY userid, created_date
		) AS s
	JOIN goldusers_signup g ON s.userid = g.userid AND s.created_date>g.gold_signup_date
	) 
WHERE rn = 1;
```
**Result Set**

| User ID | Product ID |
|---------|------------|
| 1       | 3          |
| 3       | 2          |

*This insight helps identify what products are most appealing to users right after joining the Gold program.*


- **Pre-Membership Trigger:**  
  Found the last product purchased *before* users became members. If common, this product may have influenced their decision to upgrade ‚Äî valuable for upsell strategies.

```sql
SELECT userid, product_id
FROM (
	SELECT s.userid, s.product_id, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.userid ORDER BY s.created_date DESC) as rn
	FROM (
		SELECT * 
		FROM sales
		ORDER BY userid, created_date
		) AS s
	JOIN goldusers_signup g ON s.userid = g.userid AND s.created_date<=g.gold_signup_date
	) 
WHERE rn = 1;
```

**Result Set**


| userid | product_id |
|--------|------------|
|   1    |     2      |
|   3    |     2      |

The repetition of product '2' being the trigger for gold membership is a valuable insight, we can apply this type of analysis to other factors like, total order amount, discount offered on membership or not, etc.

- **Reward Points Simulation:**

```sql
SELECT userid, SUM(Zomato_point) as Earned_Points
FROM (
		SELECT *, 
			CASE
				WHEN product_id=1 THEN total/5
				WHEN product_id=2 THEN (total/10)*5
				WHEN product_id=3 THEN total/5
			END as Zomato_point
		FROM (
			SELECT s.userid, s.product_id, SUM(p.price) as total
			FROM sales s
			JOIN
				product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
			GROUP BY s.userid, s.product_id
			ORDER BY userid
			)
		)
GROUP BY userid
ORDER BY userid;
```

Designed a custom point system based on product pricing (e.g., 5‚Çπ = 1 point). We calculated total points per user and per product, offering insight into loyalty performance by item. Here's why it stood out:

- **Logic Building & Customization:**  
  I created a tiered points system where each product had its own conversion logic (e.g., 5‚Çπ = 1 point for some, 10‚Çπ = 5 points for others). This challenged me to think creatively and structure my `CASE` statements effectively.

- **Real-World Business Application:**  
  Reward programs are crucial in increasing customer retention. This exercise showed me how to simulate such programs using SQL, helping businesses measure engagement and identify high-performing products in loyalty campaigns.

- **Analytical Depth:**  
  By analyzing total points earned per user and per product, I could identify:
  - Which customers are most loyal.
  - Which products drive repeat purchases and retention.
  - Potential for bonus campaigns (e.g., double points on low-selling items).

- **Scalable Logic:**  
  I now understand how this system could scale in real-life platforms like Zomato or Swiggy, integrating with dashboards and influencing targeted offers.

These insights bridge raw transaction data with business value ‚Äî helping decision-makers understand customer behavior, membership effectiveness, and reward optimization.

## What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to apply and deepen my SQL skills in a realistic, business-oriented scenario. Here‚Äôs what I gained from the experience:

- **Analytical Thinking:** Learned how to transform business questions into precise SQL queries and extract meaningful insights from transactional data.
- **Data Modeling Awareness:** Understood how different tables (users, products, sales, memberships) relate and how to join them meaningfully for layered analysis.
- **Window Functions Mastery:** Practiced using powerful SQL tools like `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and `ROW_NUMBER()` for solving sequencing and ranking problems.
- **Logic Building for Rewards:** Simulated custom logic such as Zomato points, combining arithmetic and CASE statements ‚Äî a great exercise in creative SQL.

---

## Conclusion

Through this project, I was able to:

- Recreate a simplified but realistic Zomato-like ecosystem.
- Analyze customer behavior before and after joining the loyalty program.
- Evaluate which products performed best and how user preferences changed with Gold Membership.
- Simulate a loyalty point system to explore its potential effectiveness.

This exercise mirrors real-world business intelligence work ‚Äî turning raw transactions into strategic insights.

---

## Future Scope

- **Visualization Integration:** The next step is to visualize these insights using tools like **Power BI** or **Tableau**, making the analysis more digestible for non-technical stakeholders.
- **Bigger Dataset Simulation:** Apply the same queries and logic to larger datasets, possibly with millions of records, to test scalability and performance.
- **Automation & Reporting:** Build dashboards and automate such analyses to support ongoing product or marketing decisions.

## Closing Thoughts

This was more than just a SQL practice project ‚Äî it was a chance to think like a **business analyst**. Every query had a purpose. Every insight told a story. Projects like these build the foundation for real-world analytics roles, and I‚Äôm excited to take this learning forward.

Thanks for checking out **The Zomato Project**!
